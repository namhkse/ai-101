# AI Assistant with LangChain, Azure OpenAI, and Tools

This script demonstrates how to build a simple **AI assistant** using **LangChain** and **LangGraph ReAct Agent** with external tools.  

## ðŸ”¹ What it does
1. **Weather Tool** â€“ Uses the `OpenWeatherMapAPIWrapper` to fetch real-time weather for any city.  
2. **Web Search Tool** â€“ Uses `TavilySearch` to retrieve the latest online information.  
3. **LLM Integration** â€“ Connects to **Azure OpenAI ChatGPT model** as the reasoning engine.  
4. **Agent Setup** â€“ Combines the tools and LLM into a **ReAct Agent** that can decide when to call each tool.  
5. **Conversation Loop** â€“ Processes a list of mock user questions (weather, AI news, sports) and returns answers.  

## ðŸ”¹ Example Output
